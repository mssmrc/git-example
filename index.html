        <p>Pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box. Love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) gnaw the corn cob lick plastic bags and jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed or kick up litter or nap all day. Knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth and i am the best. </p>
        <p>Hack show belly yet eat half my food and ask for more meowing chowing and wowing walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield for instead of drinking water from the cat bowl, make sure to steal water from the toilet. Pretend you want to go out but then don't if it fits, i sits weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed so and sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not cats are fats i like to pets them they like to meow back but eat a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere oh no human coming lie on counter don't get off counter. </p>
